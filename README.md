"# Syntecxhub_Pro_Theme_Toggle" 

A high-performance, zero-flash Dark/Light mode switcher built with a "Performance-First" architecture. This isn't just a toggle; it's a scalable theme system for modern brands.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Persistent State:** Uses `localStorage` to remember user choice across sessions.
- **CSS Variable Architecture:** Easily themeable via `:root` variables—no heavy JS manipulation.
- **Accessible UI:** Semantic HTML and ARIA-friendly toggle switch.
